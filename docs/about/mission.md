# Mission

## Motivation

The motivations behind the PATTERN project primarily revolve around enhancing the utility of data from multiple sources while maintaining strict confidentiality. The project seeks to address the challenges faced by collaborative cybersecurity systems and distributed/federated data analytics. Traditional encryption methods limit the ability to operate over encrypted data, hindering the potential for advanced federated data sharing technologies.

PATTERN aims to overcome these challenges by developing new cryptographic mechanisms to enable efficient and scalable federated computations on sensitive data without compromising privacy or integrity. This would include innovations in homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation to allow operations on encrypted data with minimal overhead.

The project is motivated by the need to provide solutions that offer both privacy protection and integrity guarantees for computations on sensitive data. These motivations are grounded in the realities of current cybersecurity threats and the increasing importance of preserving privacy in data analytics. By addressing these challenges, PATTERN aims to enable more effective and secure collaborative data analytics and cybersecurity practices.
 
## Goals

The PATTERN project aims to significantly advance the field of federated data analytics by enhancing privacy and ensuring data integrity, without sacrificing performance. The main objectives include:
